Queue - FIFO - A Queue places items on top of anothre using the push method, and removes items using the unshift method, which removes items from the beginning of the list

What is the retreival time complexity for the following data structures?

Linked List - O(n)
Hash Table - O(1)
Binary Search Trees - O(n)

What are some advantages to using a Hash Tables over an array in JavaScript?

Hash tables have an O(1) retrieval time complexity where as arrays have an o(n). Arrays can make it more complex to retrieve items in large data sets.
